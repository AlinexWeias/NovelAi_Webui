As a part of the Deforum team I (kabachuha) want this script extension to remain a part of the Deforum project.

Thus, if you want to submit feature request or bugfix, unless it only relates to automatic1111's porting issues, consider making a PR first to the parent repository notebook https://github.com/deforum/stable-diffusion.

Also, you may want to inforum the dev team about your work via Discord https://discord.gg/deforum to ensure that no one else is working on the same stuff.
